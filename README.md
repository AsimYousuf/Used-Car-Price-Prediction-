This Linear regression machine learning mini project is designed in Jupyter Notebook. 
It bases its logic on the correlation matrix and selects the appropriate input variables with respect to the target variable 'price'.
Although the mean absolute error is a little high this is a good starting point to analyse such complex data with better mathematical models in the future.
